# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Exchange-rates
As part of my Business Forecasting course in my MBA curriculum, I performed a time series forecasting in R for 4 exchange rates- USD|INR, GBP|INR, EURO|INR, YEN|INR. 
The data set ExchangeRate_Data.csv contains entries from 6th November 2013 to 9th July 2018. This data set has been pulled from Kaggle. For the purpose of forecasting, I decided to use a forecast horizon of the next 31 days.
